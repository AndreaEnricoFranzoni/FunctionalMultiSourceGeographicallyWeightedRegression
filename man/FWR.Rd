\description{
Fitting a Functional Weighted Regression model. The covariates are functional objects, stationary covariates (C), constant over geographical space.
The functional response is already reconstructed according to the method proposed by Bortolotti et Al. (2024)
}
\details{
Constant basis are used, for a covariate, if it resembles a scalar shape. It consists of a straight line with y-value equal to 1 all over the data domain.
Can be seen as a B-spline basis with degree 0, number of basis 1, using one knot, consequently having only one coefficient for the only basis for each statistical unit.
fdagwr sets all the feats accordingly if reads constant basis.
However, recall that the response is a functional datum, as the regressors coefficients. Since the package's basis variety could be hopefully enlarged in the future
(for example, introducing Fourier basis for handling data that present periodical behaviors), the input parameters regarding basis types for response, response reconstruction
weights and regressors coefficients are left at the end of the input list, and defaulted as \strong{\code{NULL}}. Consequently they will use a B-spline basis system, and should NOT use a constant basis,
Recall to perform externally the basis expansion before using the package, and afterwards passing basis types, degree and number and basis expansion coefficients and knots coherently
}
\note{
A little excursion about degree and number of basis passed as input. For each specific covariate, or the response, if using B-spline basis, remember that number of knots = number of basis - degree + 1.
By default, if passing \strong{\code{NULL}}, fdagwr uses a cubic B-spline system of basis, the number of basis is computed coherently from the number of knots (that is the only mandatory input parameter).
Passing only the degree of the bsplines, the number of basis used will be set accordingly, and viceversa if passing only the number of basis.
But, take care that the number of basis used has to match the number of rows of coefficients matrix (for EACH type of basis). If not, an exception is thrown. No problems arise if letting fdagwr defaulting the number of basis.
For response and response reconstruction weights, degree and number of basis consist of integer, and can be \strong{\code{NULL}} For all the regressors, and their coefficients, the inputs consist of vector of integers:
if willing to pass a default parameter, all the vector has to be defaulted (if passing \strong{\code{NULL}}, a vector with all 3 for the degrees is passed, for example)
